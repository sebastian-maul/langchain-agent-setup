**Project Memory Database Usage**

- Only store, update, or retrieve information in the database that is directly relevant to the current projectâ€™s requirements, code, design decisions, or development context.
- Do not use the database for general-purpose or unrelated data.
- When storing information, ensure it is concise, accurate, and useful for future development or context recall.
- Use the database to track:
  - Project requirements, goals, and constraints
  - Design decisions and their rationale
  - Relationships between code components, modules, or features
  - Open questions, TODOs, and unresolved issues
  - Key changes or milestones in the project
- Always respect privacy and do not store sensitive or personal data.
- Retrieve and use stored information only to assist with project development, context, or answering project-specific questions.
- Automatically update the project memory database with any new, changed, or clarified project-relevant information discussed during the chat, without requiring explicit user instructions to save.
